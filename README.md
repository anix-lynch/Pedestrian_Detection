# 🚶 PedestrianDetect: Pedestrian Detection Using Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

Welcome to **PedestrianDetect**! In this project, we’ll implement a machine learning-based pedestrian detection system using the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method. This technique is fundamental in intelligent video surveillance systems, enabling us to detect pedestrians in video frames accurately. Let’s dive into the world of pedestrian detection! 🚶‍♂️🚶‍♀️

## 🌐 Project Overview

Pedestrian detection is an essential aspect of computer vision, serving as the foundation for many advanced video analytics tasks. In this project, we’ll utilize the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method for pedestrian detection. The system computes gradients for each pixel in an image and creates histograms based on these gradients. The combined histograms are then used to detect pedestrians in video streams. We’ll process frames from a video using OpenCV, detect pedestrians with the HOG detector, and visualize results using Python’s plotting libraries.
